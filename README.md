# GP1-Branch-Out-Pizza

## Description

Application uses Spoontacular and Pizza-and-Deserts api's to display information.

When user clicks on the button on the front they are given a random recipe link to go to.

That link is saved in local storage to display the last 5 recipe's shown when they come back.

If they are not happy with those recipes there is a list of cards below with ideas for pizzas to try.
